# Behave-Selenium-Pytest-Allure BDD Automation Framework

Welcome to the Behave-Selenium-Pytest-Allure BDD Automation Framework repository! This project is a comprehensive and scalable automation framework built entirely from scratch using Python. It leverages the power of Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) to create robust, maintainable, and easily understandable automated test suites.

## Key Features

- **Behave:** We've chosen Behave as our BDD framework of choice. Behave allows you to write tests in plain English language, making it easy for both technical and non-technical team members to understand and contribute to test scenarios.

- **Selenium:** Selenium WebDriver is integrated seamlessly, enabling you to automate web applications with ease. You can write user-friendly, browser-based tests that simulate real user interactions.

- **Pytest:** Pytest is used as the test runner. It provides a straightforward and scalable way to organize and execute your tests, generate reports, and manage test fixtures.

- **Allure Report:** The framework generates detailed and visually appealing test reports using Allure. These reports provide a comprehensive overview of test results, making it simple to pinpoint issues and track test execution progress over time.

## Key Components

- **Feature Files:** Write test scenarios using Gherkin syntax in feature files. These files serve as a common language bridge between stakeholders and the automation team.

- **Step Definitions:** Implement step definitions in Python to map Gherkin steps to actual automation code. This separation of concerns allows for better maintainability and readability.

- **Page Objects:** Leverage the Page Object Model (POM) pattern to encapsulate web page elements and actions, promoting reusability and reducing code duplication.

- **Test Data Management:** Manage test data efficiently, ensuring that tests are repeatable and maintainable.

- **Custom Utilities:** A collection of utility functions and libraries are included to simplify common automation tasks and enhance the framework's capabilities.
